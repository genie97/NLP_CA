"Edit: Since my first review of these airpods, I've upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime to the Samsung S9. With that, my airpods no longer crack or have any static while using them within normal range. I've increased my rating from 1 to 3 stars. My reasoning for this is that I now very much enjoy them now, but they will not connect properly with every phone out there. This is new tech and requires a newer phone too. Original: Honestly, these apple airpods are a scam. The amount of static and interference that goes on is unbelievable. A 5 minute song is 3 minutes of static and cracking. Don't buy this at all for any phone. They're garbage and just a statement. I would return them but the deadline is up."
"I use air pods. Disappoint that batteries don¡¯t last very long, it jumps in and out quiet a bit. When I go to answer and it goes to my phone or my Apple Watch.It¡¯s hard to tap on ear piece when you are answering it. . I think they are use more for music. I wish they would stay charged longer. I like that you can use one ear piece at a time. Clarity is the best I have ever had in a Bluetooth ."
"While these headphones are incredibly comfortable and have a fantastic battery life, this may not be for the individual to use if  they're frequently around any background noise. While they do cancel out some noise, such as when you're driving a car, they do a poor job of cancelling background conversation or other things happening. While my husband is using them at work, I often get irritated because the background sounds are so loud, I have a hard time concentrating on what I'm saying. We end up hanging up after I ask him to call me back when he's in a quieter place."
"For music, I would rate these 5 stars. But as a Bluetooth speaker for talking on the phone almost 1 Star. It is shocking that Apple for the price, has not included any noise cancellation. We have tested it compared to a plantronics voyager. With the plantronics, I can vacuum or dry my hair and the person on the phone cannot hear it. With the Apple, it¡¯s amplified. It¡¯s a shame a company known for technology didn¡¯t incorporate noise cancellation in a very overpriced product."
I love Apple products but I am surprised that the headphones aren¡¯t on target like their other products. I use these to listen to music from my laptop and I find that I have to reset on and off many times to get both ear pieces to work at the same time. I realized too about needing to recharge it a lot if I am working 9 hours but that is managaeable. I don¡¯t like the part where the ear pieces aren¡¯t working on both sides and I have to restart the music player completely for it to work properly. Dissapointed.
"Update... After 3 months of use my husband's airpods are going in and out, sometimes having to be reset three times per session. For the amount we paid I am not that happy with these products... and it seems they only last about three hours as we use them with our TV system So far I really like these airpods! They have great sound and very light. The headsets that go around your neck hurt my neck because I have pinched nerves but these of course ride in my ears comfortably so that is no longer an issue for me. They stay in very well and have better sound than any headphones I've had, but more expensive too... I've only had them for a few days and I have an Android phone is the only reason they got a 4 instead of a 5, and some of the features that work with Apple phones do not work with Android phones as well. I can tap mine to pause audio, but the downside is when someone is talking to you you have to pull it out of your ear and there's no volume control on the earpiece itself of course because it's small and compact. I love the ease of charging, pairing and the comfort of wearing them though... I'm interested to see how tough they are... sometimes stuff just happens so I'll keep you posted after I've had them longer than a few days. But for now I really like them Android phone and all ??"
"These are not the end-all, be-all of headphones, as reviews might indicate. I like them for the compact design, auto-pause feature when you remove one, and the ability to quickly recharge. What I don't like is that they fall out easily if you rest your head on anything (by applying force to the lower of the unit like a lever), are generally not super comfortable for my ears, and cost a ton as far as earbuds go. My suggestion would be to get a cheap pair of $30 BT headphones like the Phaiser 730 and then, if you want a pair for desk work and travel, put the $120 towards some decent noise canceling over-the-ear headphones like Boise Quiet Comfort."
"LOVE THEN! However; I¡¯ve been having problems with the left one off and on. Sometimes it holds no charge, sometimes never turns on. If it weren¡¯t for lefty, it¡¯d be 5 stars. Also, I do with the sound went up a little higher. But it has great features like the battery life and extrembly fast charge! They don¡¯t fall out of my ears during intense vigorous exercise either which is why I purchased them."
"I bought these for my wife so she could use them for working out. They didn't stay in her ears and barely stayed in mine. Definitely no confidence in the fitment. We purchased some rubber skins to go on them and they fit a little better, but would not go in the case to charge. We ended up returning everything. Sound quality was decent, but have heard better from ones that seal up to your ear better."
"I bought one pair that were missing the buds, and the second pair I had a week before the lid popped open and I lost one while traveling."
"I purchased refurbished and that was a mistake. The left earbud didn¡¯t work and I had to return. Pairing was also glitchy. However, these would be amazing if they worked properly. It¡¯s not worth saving 20 bucks and not have the apple warranty. Once my return is processed, i¡¯ll But new ones. Hope they don¡¯t have the same problems as the refurbished AirPod, but at least I¡¯ll have some warranty protection. So much more convenient for running. No more fishing cords up my sleeve from my arm band. Sound is nothing spectacular, but I want to be able to hear my surrounding as I run, so I¡¯m not looking for perfect crisp sound."
They have great sound quality but continually pop out of my ears and if I yawn or move my mouth in a certain way it stops the music and have to maually restart or take bud totally out of my ear and put back in..
"I like to listen to music while I hit balls at the driving range, Airpods do not work for this activity as they continually fall out. Fine for sedentary activities, but not for an active person."
I use these for my running routine and they¡¯re great when they charge. I use them a few times a week and sometimes the battery on one earbud is dead and I¡¯m stuck having to listen to one. Word to the wise: charge them frequently.
"Brand new, sealed in the box..wouldn¡¯t connect to my phone, dealing w apple from here on out. Defective. Serial number is clean in apple system and warranty is valid for 1 year. Positive review. I don¡¯t believe this is the sellers fault, although an inconvenience, will be corrected faster through apple."
"Connectivity is not as expected, sometimes It takes time to Pair to my iPhone or when I swap between WhatsApp calls and phone calls, the AirPods stop being transmitting the call even if they appear to be paired. Too much pain to go back and forth trying to pair them back for the phone call."
"Do you want to pay lots of money for the privilege of walking around looking like you have tampons in your ear? then this is your product. with blue tooth head sets going out of fashion there was a serious void in ""expensive things i can wear that make me look stupid"" niche market .Well count on Apple to know how to innovate in that field! Now the folks at the indie coffee shop will have to respect you for being a the for front of misguided loyalty. (that uptick in giggling around you really is directed at you when you wear these)"
I¡¯m not sure what it is about these but they¡¯re really painful. I tried silicone ear hooks to soften it but it still hurts. The person I gifted them to developed a painful cut in his ear due to the ridge along the top.
"I bought these hoping they would work. I bought them wanting the easy pair convenience and to be apart of that group of people with the little white pods hangin out of their ear. Sadly, these are not made for all. Every time I went for a run, the left one would fall out. Maybe it¡¯s me! Maybe I have emerged ear canals, but I didn¡¯t want to buy a third party silicone tip that wouldn¡¯t be able to remain on in the charging case. I had to return these and ended up purchasing the Jabrab Elite 65t¡¯s. They are truly wonderful, please feel free to check out my review for them."
"These are pretty good headphones (nice sound for sure). Unfortunately, the batteries only last 4 or so hours on a charge, so they're not great for all-day listening (unless you have a few breaks where you can charge them). Also, I've found them hard to keep in my ears- they fall out at even the slightest disturbance (and I LOVE similarly sized wired headphones from Apple). For example, I was on a subway and removed my shoulder bag over my head, which jostled my ear and one fell out. I had one fall out in an elevator when someone else bumped into me. And I was just at the gym, laying down doing bench presses, and one of them fell out! That doesn't exactly fill me with confidence..."
"For 150$, I was thinking of wireless headphones that would work like a coordinated orchestra, but unfortunately it doesn't. My airpods, when connected to my iphone, sometimes cuts off and has a ringing when first connected. Although, not as often as when it's connected to my dell laptop via bluetooth. When connected to my dell laptop, it has this weird glitch where the audio gets jumbled, discombobulated for a brief 1/2 seconds every 5-10 seconds (which can be extremely annoying when you're trying to watch a lecture on youtube or listening to music)."
This is my second one as i lost the first one. The problem i have with this one is that charging it is a problem. I have to manipulate the charger multiple times in and out before it starts to charge despite using the original apple charging cable. Doesnt charge at all if the charger is not apple.
Come on apple - these are silly. The sound is great but only if you are sitting stock still. I dunno maybe if you are bald or wear earmuffs they might stay. but they are so small they are easy to lose and really not comfortable.
"Great sound. But NOT for sports, they slip and bounce right out of sweaty ears. Consider your planned use carefully, and buy where you return if it doesn¡¯t work for you."
"Connectivity is not as expected, sometimes It takes time to Pair to my iPhone or when I swap between WhatsApp calls and phone calls, the AirPods stop being transmitting the call even if they appear to be paired. Too much pain to go back and forth trying to pair them back for the phone call."

"I am a huge Apple fan!! These are great earbuds, but I couldn't keep them in my ears and tried every method I could find online. Sound quality is outstanding - just didn't work for me."
"I am a huge Apple products fan and bought these as a present to myself for my birthday. I workout every morning and these AirPods are great, but my $30 LG Bluetooth headphones that rest on my neck work just as well for a fraction of the price. I like the double tap feature and how you can program it to do different things. I wish you could say, ¡°Hey, Siri,¡± and the headphones would automatically activate Siri but that is not the case. I feel like the case and the overall material quality is exceptional, but I like to have my music loud, and even when I turn it up to maximum volume I feel as though there could have been a little more loudness as far as volume level is concerned. These have never fallen out, but when I do HIIT workouts, sometimes I¡¯m nervous they will! Also, connectivity issues have been far and few, but for a product at this price point, I shouldn¡¯t have a problem switching between my iPhone and my MacBook Pro, but sometimes there are weird issues where it won¡¯t switch, or connection is a problem right out of the case. I gave this product three stars because, while they have cool features and are made of great quality, connectivity issues and overall sound quality and volume are lacking. I hope this helps some of you who are on the fence like I was to make a more informed decision. I would recommend buying them if you¡¯re as involved in the Apple ecosystem as I am, but if you are wondering if $150 is worth it, I would unfortunately have to say you could find better options at a more affordable price!"

"For those worried about receiving knockoffs, I received authentic AirPods. I ordered new, directly from Amazon. I was able to authenticate them by checking the serial number through Apple¡¯s online warranty check. By verifying the purchase date and entering the serial number, I was granted a full year warranty. All in all, they work great and I¡¯m very pleased. Hope this helps!"
"I've always thought these looked stupid and hell, I still think they look stupid. After starting a new job where wired headphones became a pain, I decided to give these a whirl and tried a friend's out for a day. I ordered these an hour later. The battery is top notch, the sound quality is so much better than the EarPods and the ease of controlling these things makes it Apple. I use them every day for ~6 hours and they're something I wouldn't bat an eye at buying again . . . even if my bank account would rather me not. Worth the money."
"I was soooo skeptical on ordering these since I ordered some cheap crappy ones from here that wasn't even worth the $29.00 I paid for them. I had $200 in gift cards so I ordered these and I'm very happy thus far. Prior to opening the seal I checked the serial number and it checked out as valid and that a warranty was still in effect. I did my own unboxing video and compared it to others online and I'm pretty sure these are the real deal. Once I took them out of the package and open them they immediately registered on my phone and I must say the sound is amazing. Great Purchase, Happy Happy Customer..."
Hands down the best money I've ever spent! I was iffy about them falling out when I first purchased them but I have had zero issues with that even when doing intense activities like sprinting and HIIT training. They seamlessly pair with my Iphone just by opening the case! I can control the volume and change the song playing in the headphones with my Apple watch so it's amazing during workouts! Another cool feature is that they automatically pause the music when you pull one out and resume when you put them back in your ear. GENIUS! The case packs an extra charge so I can go quite a while without having to re-charge. The case is sleek and small enough to hook onto my keys (I bought a silicone cover) without making them bulky. I would recommend again and again and again!!!!
excellent product with the unknown advantage of being water proof. survived a wash cycle in a washing machine and are still working perfectly??
"I bought these mostly to use at work. It detects when it is in my ear so if someone approaches I just take one out and it automatically stops the music, then when I put it back in, it starts back right where I left off. Also these are not noise cancelling so it may not be the best for the plane but I need to be able to hear when the phone rings so it works great for office use."
"I was so skeptical. I¡¯ve been through so many blue tooth¡¯s for my job. They all fall out, make my ears sore etc... these are in fact more comfortable than the earbuds that come standard with iPhones. In fact I forget they¡¯re in. Sound quality is excellent and I even shook my head as hard as I could to make them fall out and they didn¡¯t budge. I even did a flipping cartwheel and they stayed put!!!!!!! I¡¯m an AirPod convert. Nothing even compares."
"These are a really nice high quality item. Got mine for $144.95 from Amazon Services and they appear brand new as advertised, but checking a week later I can¡¯t see them listed for anything less than $175 or more. Looks like I got a good deal and will update if I find otherwise. They come up on phone as ¡°Bruce¡¯s AirPods¡±, so that¡¯s a good sign for authenticity. The sound is great, exceeds expectations. Can¡¯t rate durability yet, but they seem typical Apple high quality. Battery life is as advertised and charging is very quick as advertised. Expensive, but seems like it is going to be a purchase I¡¯m not going to regret and I can see where all that extra money went. They are very comfortable to wear and stay put even when shaking my head. They are more comfortable than any device I have tried with rubber mounts and the hard design seems more sanitary and easy to clean. When snoozing with ear on pillow, ear can still get sore after a long while, but again better than anything else I have tried. Sometimes you do get what you paid for. I have significant hearing loss in both ears and the live listen feature works really well. There is virtually no delay between the live sounds and what I hear through buds and I am going to use these as a poor man¡¯s hearing aid, again exceeding expectations with adequate amplification and superb sound quality from my iphones¡¯ microphone. Overall very pleased and I must have caught these at a very good price. If anything turns out different I will immediately update. So far so good. After reading more one star reviews vs the low price I paid, I¡¯m now a little concerned, but seems I got the real deal from Amazon Services being listed as the supplier. If I find otherwise, you will see an update to this review. One last thing, they come with a cable, but no transformer strangely. I guess Apple figures you already must have one. The charging time is so fast that there is really no competition, so I¡¯m OK with it and happy to keep the price down on an already expensive luxury item. Not dealing with tangled wires that seem to snag on every door knob when both hands are full is so nice indeed. Go ahead and spend the money, absolutely worth it!"
"I head heard great things from my co workers and even though I have Sony over ear headphones, I got these for working out and such. They have lived up to the hype and connect seamlessly with my iPhone! Great range and they always stay in my ears. Working out with these instead corded headphones is 10x better! Battery life is good but not amazing - the portable floss sized container for charging is convenient."
"I never have liked the way Apple earbuds fit. So when My wife surprise me with these for Christmas I thought ¡°oh no¡± I won¡¯t like the way they fit. When I put them in I was quite surprised, they were very comfortable. And the battery life is very good, I get around 8 hours of play time with a pause here and there. And the most important thing I want to say is they did survive a trip through the washer. I know I thought well there went $200.00 . If you don¡¯t already then you should start saving silica dry packs (desiccant packs) I have a quart size Ziploc baggie of them so I put the AirPods on the case in there and close them up, patiently waiting to give them about 3 to 4 days in the bag and then I plug them in and had to hold the reset button on the back of the case for about 20 seconds and then they started working taking a charge they survived with no problems I think that is amazing I¡¯m not sure that I would recommend washing them but they did come back from the dead. We read that you should not use rice because that causes corrosion. Now my wife and I both own a pair I love them. If you¡¯re using these with an iPhone It¡¯s nice you don¡¯t have to have your phone out to make a call, answer a call, read or send a text message, or pause and play your music."
"Very good headphones! They automatically pause your music or video when you take one or both pods out (this setting can be changed.) You can set wether a double tap pauses your music, skips to the next selection, etc. Soon as you double tap, the response time is quick. I¡¯ve dropped the case and one of the pods on some hard wood floor at some point. They still work very good so that must imply durability. The sound quality is great as well! I shook my head really hard, they stay in. When I go running they stay put. I wear them in the shower when I don¡¯t have to wash my hair. The only downside is that the sound can be slightly ¡°late¡± when it comes to beat-making apps so it¡¯s hard to stay on beat. But for youtube videos it¡¯s completely on time!"
"At first, I went back and forth about spending so much on a Bluetooth headset. I have bought countless knockoffs, too many to count, thinking they¡¯d be suffice. Every single cheap headset I¡¯ve purchased has broken or breaks up a few feet from my device. Not one has been noteworthy. The AirPods work. I can keave my main device upstairs, and go into the basement for stretches without interference, and this with several walls and stairs blocking the headset from the main device. You can go all around a house, garage, etc without missing a beat. I haven¡¯t tried it outside yet, but that would probably work too. There are no buttons to push in hopes of getting a connection, or anything of the sort. It connects to Your device by proxy and holds an amazing charge. I¡¯m beyond impressed. And kicking myself for spending hundreds on cheap, knockoff devices. This just proves that 99 percent of the time when you buy the knockoff you get knockoff quality."
"After reading some of the reviews I was skeptical to buy this given that some people say they have gotten knock-offs (or even a Duracell battery in one case). I checked my serial number online and the produce is indeed genuine. Many years ago, I bought an early ipod and spent weeks dealing with technical support. Ultimately, Apple just issued me a refund. The experience left me completely jaded with Apple products. My firm gave me an iphone and I decided to buy some airpods. The airpods have completely changed my view of Apple for the better. The airpods are well built and connect flawlessly with my iphone 8 plus. The sound is incredible, and yes they stay in your ears even when running at the gym. They are a bit pricey but are completely worth it. As a person who formerly said they would never buy another Apple product it is hard to say.....but....well done Apple! These things are totally awesome!"
"They were a bit of a splurge purchase, but everyone was going on about them. The hype was right! I absolutely love not getting tangled in wires. I have never lost or even come close to misplacing them because I love them so much. I'm always aware of where they are. You won't be disappointed, I'm sure. I do have some notes for Apple about how i'd like to see the next model improved, but these are great even so. For example, I wish I could customize th action associated with tapping the airpod. I don't like Siri, and in fact I really hate how Siri turns on whenever i brush against the device. I would rather tap to change volume or skip a song. Oh well! Maybe in the next one."
"I was on the phone with her when it arrived. To her surprise, as soon as she opened them up her phone prompted her to pair them. Magic I tell you. Phone calls are clearer when we speak and she's in the car. Music pauses when you remove one. She says they sound great, loves the fact that they have a long battery life and that the case charges them as well. Probably one of the better gifts I've given and I've given some expensive gifts in my time."
"I tried a couple of different Bluetooth headsets (behind the neck ones) and ear buds (skullcandys) before I bought the AirPods. I got to the point where I couldn¡¯t go a single day without a Bluetooth headset to the point where I would decide my day was going to suck if I forgot them at home. Seriously people I know this review is for AirPods but if you don¡¯t know what having a Bluetooth headset and or AirPods in all day it¡¯s an awesome experience. Anyways I listen to a lot of podcasts and music as I work also so that¡¯s why I chose to get these especially after all the positive reviews I saw from pretty much everywhere.After having these for 4 months I simply can¡¯t live without them. I love my AirPods. They are the coolest piece of tech that you can buy for yourself.Fit is extremely comfortable for my ears. They are very lightweight and can be worn all day and you will hardly notice that they are there. They don¡¯t seal like other earbuds which I thought at first was going to be a draw back but it ends up being an advantage. This is because you can be listening to whatever you are like listening to and still hear things that are going on around you (traffic, people getting you¡¯re attention, etc) as long as you¡¯re not blasting the volume.Sound quality is good. You¡¯re not going to find anything this size and weight and this compact and completely wireless that will sound this good. They aren¡¯t like nose quiet comforts or anything but many will be hard pressed to be disappointed. They have decent base and do not distort and high volumes.Battery life is great I often use one of these at a time and can stretch battery life from my AirPods case for 3 days.If you have an iPhone buy them. Yes they are expensive but they are the coolest most useful buds in the business. Just like the iPhone when it came out, you didn¡¯t know you needed one until you used it. These are the same and they are here to stay. Lastly they work seemlesly with the iPhone but also work with android. I actually had an S8+ when I bought the AirPods and they worked perfectly with them. Anyways folks don¡¯t spend your money on cheaper options. I went through 2 other sets before buying these and these are the best in the industry. Oh and don¡¯t bother waiting for the new AirPods to come out. Buy these, enjoy the hell out of them and I bet you¡¯ll buy the new one whenever they come out haha. They¡¯re that good."
"Been looking for ever for a pair of ear buds I like. And I love these! Sound quality is on point, they connect easy and they stay in. I¡¯ve tried multiple brands and these were the best I¡¯ve found by far. Glad I finally gave them a chance. I just try ones that go into my ear to stay put more but I have no problem with it now. No cords is my favorite part and getting to use one at a time to double listen time is amazing! Charging case is smaller and lighter than most other brands as well which I really love! Thank you apple for yet an other amazing product!"
"AirPods, AirPods, everyone hated the look of you be now look who¡¯s king! AirPods are definitely a good investment and I¡¯ve found myself using them a lot for music and watching videos. Sound quality is pretty good, maybe a little better than the standard EarPods, could use a little more bass but other than that it¡¯s awesome! As for the materials used for AirPods, it¡¯s glossy plastic, at first I thought that if I was paying $159 for Bluetooth headphones I would need a better material but this material feels premium. One con about it though is it gets VERY dirty. Lots of random things kinda stick to the case and lots of trash gets stuck in the case. Battery life is also, unexceptional, of course it¡¯s Apple! The earbuds themselves last around 5 hours and the case can charge it 5 more times, for a total around 24 hours!! I can go WEEKS without charging the casing. The charging is fast and it can get 3 hours of playtime in just 15 minutes. Amazing. I¡¯ve tested these underwater, they last and don¡¯t stop working, but if you use them in a pool or you¡¯re fully submerged under water than they don¡¯t play music... Don¡¯t worry! It¡¯s not the AirPods fault! It¡¯s just hard for a Bluetooth signal to get under water, not that you broke your shiny new $159 AirPods. The paring is seemless. So many options to customize these little things! It automatically pauses music if you take one out of your ear, great if you need to chat. In conclusion, AirPods is a great buy. With pretty good sound quality, GREAT battery life and premium glossed plastic they are a great buy and I wouldn¡¯t return them. Sure, $159 is a lot to spend on some earbuds, but it¡¯s apple, it¡¯s gonna be high quality and it will probably put a hole in your wallet. So if you¡¯re looking for some nice Bluetooth earbuds and have some money to spend, then I reccomend them, however, if you use android or would like better sound quality I would reccomend that you save for some Beats Solo 3¡¯s, which have the same seamless pairing process with the W1 chip, or if you have an android device, you could just get WAY cheaper Bluetooth earbuds as the special features of the AirPods aren¡¯t compatible with anything other than Apple products. NOT Saying that AirPods aren¡¯t compatible with anything other than apple products, just its special features. Thank you for reading this long post."
"I was a sceptic originally because I didn¡¯t think they¡¯d stay in my ears (similar to Apple¡®s wired EarPods) but you can buy cheap silicon ¡°wings¡± that secure over these in order to fit more snugly. I also thought the sound quality would be mediocre like many BT headsets, particularly when on conference calls. I was incorrect ? these sound crisp on both ends and they don¡¯t cut in and out like many other BT headsets. The battery life is decent; not the beat, but certainly not poor. Overall, I¡¯d highly suggest these. In fact, if I ever lose this pair I¡¯d find myself reordering instantly."
"I see a lot of reviews on here mentioning third party sellers and issues with AirPods, which caused me some concern. I ordered these a few weeks back (Jan/2019), received them promptly, and can confirm that they are authentic. Perhaps the old reviews are from a period where Amazon was selling something that was not directly from Apple, but I can confirm that the AirPods I have received are direct from Apple and have no issues. Connected directly out of the box with great sound quality."
"The real deal. They're my favorite headphones to use now. So lightweight that I forget I'm wearing them sometimes (can be good or bad lol). I haven't had an issue with running in them, but might just be due to the shape of my ear. They are not noise-cancelling. I wish they were, but found out it's purposely not so runners can hear a car passing them. You can buy attachments/ear hooks to make them a little more noise-cancelling, but it's difficult to put them in the case, so I just wear them as is."
Don't waste your money on any other type of wireless devices. These are fantastic and well worth the cost. You pull them out of their case (where they are ALWAYS ready and charged up!) and they instantly connect to your iPhone. The sound is great and the voice quality is flawless. If you are wavering -- stop right now and order them!!
It took me a little bit to jump on the AirPod bandwagon but I¡¯m so glad I did. I bought them mainly for work so I can listen to my music while I work or even enjoy my shows at lunch privately. The charge lasts a long time for me and the responsiveness with my phone makes me happy to hear that little chirp when it knows it¡¯s in your ear. They are as good if not better than the standard cable cords. Much more comfortable than the cables ones & seem smaller. Long periods of time I have to take them out bc they do start to irritate my ear and will feel sweaty but can start using them again after a few minutes without trouble. Really glad I splurged on these
"There's really no comparison to other wireless ear buds I've purchased. The sound quality is amazing, both for listening to music and podcasts as well as for talking on the phone. The pods are light as feathers and fit so comfortably in my ears. They never fall out, even during a rigorous work-out. The only drawback is that they are so easy to lose. You must keep the charging case with you at all times and leave the pods in there when you're not using them. I strongly recommend buying a silicone cover for the case with a clip that attaches to your belt loop. It may look dorky, but it'll save you the heartache of losing these expensive pods."
"These airpods hold the signature superior quality and sound clarity of apple audio (as well as the traditional lack of noise canceling), and the only complaint I had was that there was a visible seam where two different parts came together on the airpods. One primary aspect one considers when purchasing wireless earbuds is the battery life. However, the airpods case is a boon to this problem, as whenever you're not using them, simply placing them in the case will automatically charge them. The magnetic ports were a nice touch that added a sense of luxury to the clean design of the case while adding practicality. The airpods themselves have never run out of battery on me, and I use my airpods every day. They are great for working out because they leave your the rest of your ear open as to not generate excess heat, and they stay in your ear even during intense workouts."
"I have wanted these for some time now. I use Bluetooth to talk on my iPhone at home, it makes it more clear. But these airpods (which took getting used to bc my ears canals are rather small) are a godsend. I can hear so much better, and so can the person I¡¯m calling. My 91 yr. old mother always had a hard time hearing our convyuntil I got these. I love them and are worth every penny"
"I¡¯ve always found the Apple EarPods to be uncomfortable and left a little to be desired in the sound department. I was reluctant to buy the AirPods since they seemed to be the same design. After reading some reviews and opinions from others I knew who had bought the AirPods, I decided to give them a try. SO GLAD I DID! Even though they look the same as the EarPods, they have a different feel. They do NOT fall out of my ears or make them sore with long periods of wear and the sound (to me) sounds a lot better than the EarPods. It¡¯s a richer sound. They work flawlessly with my Apple Watch and iPhone and I love that all I have to do is pop them in my ears and they connect automatically. Buy em! I think you¡¯ll like em too :)"
"First of all, I was a little skeptical and worried about purchasing these since some people were saying they didn¡¯t receive authentic AirPods. Well, I ordered new, directly from Amazon, and I received authentic and unopened ones. They work great, sound quality is high, connectivity was quick and easy, and are much more comfortable than I initially expected. I got a phone call right as I connected them as well, and I had no trouble. Microphone seemed to work perfectly fine as well. They were however priced $10 higher than Apple sells them for, but since I had money in Amazon gift cards + American Express points to apply towards my purchase, it didn¡¯t really make a difference to me. My husband and I both had beats headphones previously, and both have a pair of these now. Definitely recommend this product, especially if you are an Apple user."
I was so hesitant about these headphones that I put off buying them for about a year. Once I upgraded to the Xs I decided why not go fully wireless. I must say the sound from them is a significant step up from the normal Earbuds. The battery life last about 8-10 hours per session of constant use and charges back up in about 20-30 minutes. You can get about 5 charge cycles before you have to charge the actual unit. Only issue is the left one doesn¡¯t stay in my ear all the time but that¡¯s an easy fix with some of the accessories you can find on here for them.
"I use them every day, mostly for listening to podcasts. I use them running with my Apple Watch. They have never fallen out. I do sometimes have connectivity issues, but I think it's a watch problem. No tech I have ever owned has brought as much joy as these have. I've convinced at least 5 other people to buy them. Highly recommend!"
These things aren?t Apple AirPods!!! They failed to connect to my iPhone so I had to call Apple to figure it out. They couldn?t so I had to take them into the Genius Bar where they told me they were counterfeit!!! Sending back for a refund!!!
These headphones finally came and they couldn?t connect I tried everything but nothing works these are defective and not supported by apple I don?t recommend.
"I purchased two pairs of these Airpods. One pair, when trying to connect to them via bluetooth, lists the Airpods as a phone number instead of ""Airpods"" the way the second set does. This is a clear indication they are refurbished. Someone else owned them. I called the phone number that pops up and sure enough, it is someones cell phone. I will be requesting a refund. Be very careful."
"Very disappointed with this order. I opened what looked like brand new packaged headphones only to find visibly used AirPods with earwax on both. When I paired them with my phone, they were already named ?Sara?s AirPods?, and to make things even worse, the left AirPod does not charge properly. These are listed as brand new and in original packaging, and the headphones I received couldn?t be farther from that. Truly appalled."
"Well I liked them, but they quit working after about 6 weeks. I've even contacted Apple, Talked with an engineer for 2 days. They did not help me. They did not call back today. I have a 6 series phone , planning on updating very soon, I don't think this should matter. I really think I should get another pair or get my money back. Please review and let me know."
"was very excited to order these, came with prime read the reviews I was skeptical to order off amazon and not the actual apple website... they came within 2 days nothing was wrong with the box everything looked super professional and real I went to connect them to my phone and they wouldn?t connect... so I charged them for at least 3 hours and still wouldn?t connect, then I restarted my phone and turned off bluetooth and turned it back on then I sat with the case open for a while and still nothing!!! I then looked up what I should do and everything said they should have already connected... finally I compared the ones I ordered to my friend who got hers from the apple store and we noticed some subtle differences... overall I wouldn?t order from anywhere other than the apple website/ store... very disappointed!!"
"Good product if it charged well in the dock. Since I bought it, the left AirPod persistently does not charge in the dock, except on rare occasions. I have tried cleaning it, airing it out, etc to remove any dust or particles, and nothing seems to allow it to charge. The light stays green saying irs charged but once attempting to use, it is ineffective. Very expensive product to not work. Disappointed."
So frustrating!!!!!!!!!! My daughter opened them today and inside was Chinese knock off?s. I don?t know if it came from the manufacture that way or whatever but I am very frustrated!!! They were in a real Apple AirPod box and sealed with the plastic wrap and everything. So I wouldn?t necessarily say that it was Amazon?s fault but I am nervous to buy stuff like that from Amazon in case someone else put a knock off inside of it. We are leaving for Disneyland today and now I don?t have air pots for the trip. Again I am not mad at Amazon I am just frustrated because people do stupid things to make money .
I purchased these on October 15 and they are already dead. They do not hold a charge at all even when plugged in for 24 hours. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase because i spent $150 on these and they worked for maybe 4 weeks. What a rip off. I am trying to figure out how to fix these or return them but Apple will not do anything about it. I would advise looking into other wireless earbuds.
"The product I received was very obviously used. There was no indication that the AirPods would not be in original packaging with all original parts included. Very disappointed and will be contavting Amazon. But directly from a distributor, skip these. They?re the same price as new AirPods"
These are not Apple brand. Apple AirPods come with 1 year warranty. I checked serial number on ale website to see if these had warranty and these didn?t. Called Apple and they said that a legit apple product will have a warranty. These were a scam!!! Double check everything to make sure it?s legit. Disappointed with Amazon.
They was use AirPods expected them to be clean and not broken after spending 152.00 worst product I have bought never again!! Also for the selling if you going to sell air make sure you clean the air wax and don?t sell broken product!!!!
Not sure how these were even set up forresale bought the used-like new pair and they do absolutely nothing. Charged them for a few hours and nothing. Battery light doesn?t even come. Returning immediately. Buyer beware.
"The one I got didn't connected to my iPhone even after 100 tries. The Airpods widget which should come up once you bring your Airpods close to Iphone was not coming up and hence, the Airpods were not being detected by the iPhone. I took them Apple store and they realized there is some problem in the product. So they replaced them and gave me new ones. The new ones are working awesome. So, I would say, as a product, Airpods are awesome but not sure if the ones sold here are authentic or not."
"Awful product. When I received the product, the edges of the box looked as if it had been wet. When I opened the box the top of the ?charging case? snapped off. I believe that these were a knock off of Apple?s product."
Hate them. The battery only lasts 2 hours. Sometimes I?ll be on the phone and the phone will randomly connect to the AirPods even though they aren?t even in my ear.
I have been using this product for one month and The voice quality is far better in general apple earphones and it gets disconnected automatically while I am on a call though the charging is full. Tap for siri works once in 10 taps.
"Opened this product, tried to connect and it did not work. Called Apple support and looks like the item is damaged or not working properly after trouble shooting on two separate apple devices to ensure they were the Airpods. Item was also a bit dirty and potentially had been used as there were white/light specks indicating possible ear wax. Now I need to go to the Apple Store to see what my options are. Would highly recommend not purchasing from Amazon."
"Don?t believe all the propaganda. The reality is that these things suffer from exactly the same connectivity issues all Bluetooth devices have. I?ve owned two pairs and both connected easily only about half of the time. Of course, the times when they refused to connect, threw error messages or just plain didn?t work would be when I was driving or doing something where I couldn?t stop and mess with them. Way too frequently I have to force my phone?s Bluetooth setup to ?forget? the AirPods and start the connection process all over again. The screen to do it is less cryptic than average for Bluetooth devices, but still wastes several minutes of my time having to run the setup again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Annoying, right? Essentially, all Bluetooth earbuds stink, these just stink ever so slightly less - for five times the price."
"I wish I could give zero stars. These DO NOT WORK. After purchasing my first pair Apple has replaced it twice, and my third pair just broke again this week. Always the same: random audio dropouts on either the left or the right side. Apple clearly knows there's a problem as they replace practically no questions asked (rare for them to EVER admit there's a problem with their hardware). I'm not even going to waste time standing in line at the ridiculous Apple store this time: they're in the trash. Don't throw your money away. Every one I know who owns them has the same problem."
"For the first few months, you think... man these are amazing. But I have now been through my second pair and neither have lasted longer than 3 months of normal use. I wear them to the gym but they never get sweaty because I don?t wear them for high intensity workouts. The first pair: the tap feature stopped in both headphones so I took them to be swapped. The second pair: started having connection issues and would disconnect after 25 minutes at the gym and you needed the case with you to try and reconnect. Only after you forget the device and reconnect. Maybe if these things were 49.99 I?d be okay with the awful product. But they are expensive to be soooo cheap!"
"Word of warning if you own AirPods....DO NOT lose the charging case. My daughter lost hers and I have been trying for over an hour to purchase a replacement, which is available only by talking to Apple Support. The catch is that you MUST have the serial number. Where is that located....INSIDE the charging case (well if I had that I wouldn't need to replace a lost one!), on the original box (who keeps all that!?) and on the receipt if you purchased direct from Apple. OR you can find it in your settings on your phone....BUT the Airpods must be on and connected in order to see the serial number. But if you can't charge them and they are dead, they do not even show on your phone. My other option....I can go to an Apple Store (which is 3 hours away) and they MAY be able to get me another case without the serial number. WTH!? I will be placing my review on this product anywhere and everywhere I can find to do so."
"I bought these and I am disgusted from what I see, I noticed even before opening them the tape holding them together is broken and I wanted to see what damage is on the air pods and I see the little cube thing that hold them together is all scrached,and I open the pod and see it?s all dirty and I bought too and one of them had EAR WAX!!! EAR WAX OMG!! And the other one had had a bit of damage to it. I am completely disgusted and I want my money back please who ever sees this item DO NOT BUY IT EVEN IF THERES GOOD REVIEWS DO NOT BUY IT. I bought it because of all the good reviews,there?s a few bad one but I saw more good one but I?m disgusted."
"Only 5 hours of listening time? FOR OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS? That's bs. I had soem for only 20 bucks that lasted for EIGHTEEN HOURS on a single charge! And this is the stupidest design I've ever seen. Normal Bluetooth earphones have a short wire so they can hang around your neck. Also so you won't drop or lose them. But you know, stupid iPhone users will buy whatever crap Apple throws at them."
I love Apple products but I was terribly disappointed with the AirPod. Apple Not ALL ears are created equal so please STOP making a one size fit all head phones!! I could not get the pieces to stay in my ears. I had not experience this problem with other wireless head phones. Please fix it.
"AirPods are just hard plastic wireless earbuds that provide zero noise isolation. Simply adding a rubber or silicone flange would go a long way to make the product better. Because of the poor isolation you can hear all background noise/sounds, requiring you increase the volume to overcome. Very bad for your hearing! Voice calls are very poor as well, whoever your calling will hear all background sounds as the mic apparently has no cancellation capabilities. Returned my pair after a week of use, found them not useful at all unless you're in a very quiet area."
Purchased these right when they came out. They have never worked as advertised which is open them up and they seamlessly connect to your device. This only happens some times. The left ear piece had trouble connecting and Apple replaced them with a new pair. Same issue with new pair except the right won't won't connect all the time. Pairing sometime works great (you should not have to pair them more than once though). Today I unpaired them and could not get them to re-pair. Apple support could not either. I also used these with my Apple watch when they were working. They are suppose to pair automatically with the watch after you select the source however if you are near your iPhone they constantly pair with the phone even though I told them to pair with the watch. Solution for this was to have to turn off my iPhone. Bottom line they just do not work like they promised IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT BUT WAIT UNTIL VERSION 2!!!! Sound quality was just ok also nothing great. Apple is replace them AGAIN.
The Airpods fall out of my ears unless I stay absolutely still. Doing anything active is impossible. If your ear canal isn't quite the right size and shape then you are out of luck. Do not purchase until you've had a chance to try them on and see if your ears can hold them in. All of the third-party workarounds are testament to how common this Airpod fit problem is. Unfortunately none of the third party solutions I've tried work well at all.
"If you want to look ridiculous while working out, then they are for you. Seeing people at the gym bend over to pick up the one that fell out of their ear has become an everyday occurrence. Not sure why they have a 1 inch piece hanging off them when they are wireless. I guess it is too much to ask to just have them rest in you ear like a hearing aide. Whatever the case, I won't wear them again."
Worst decision I have made in a long time. I expected way better for $150. These AirPods continually loose connection from my iPhone! Forcing me to go into the settings and reconnect them. The whole point of these were for the ease of use with other Apple products!!!
