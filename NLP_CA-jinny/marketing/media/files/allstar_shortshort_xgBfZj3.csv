"While these headphones are incredibly comfortable and have a fantastic battery life, this may not be for the individual to use if  they're frequently around any background noise. While they do cancel out some noise, such as when you're driving a car, they do a poor job of cancelling background conversation or other things happening. While my husband is using them at work, I often get irritated because the background sounds are so loud, I have a hard time concentrating on what I'm saying. We end up hanging up after I ask him to call me back when he's in a quieter place."
