"Edit: Since my first review of these airpods, I've upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime to the Samsung S9. With that, my airpods no longer crack or have any static while using them within normal range. I've increased my rating from 1 to 3 stars. My reasoning for this is that I now very much enjoy them now, but they will not connect properly with every phone out there. This is new tech and requires a newer phone too. Original: Honestly, these apple airpods are a scam. The amount of static and interference that goes on is unbelievable. A 5 minute song is 3 minutes of static and cracking. Don't buy this at all for any phone. They're garbage and just a statement. I would return them but the deadline is up."
"I use air pods. Disappoint that batteries don¡¯t last very long, it jumps in and out quiet a bit. When I go to answer and it goes to my phone or my Apple Watch.It¡¯s hard to tap on ear piece when you are answering it. . I think they are use more for music. I wish they would stay charged longer. I like that you can use one ear piece at a time. Clarity is the best I have ever had in a Bluetooth ."
"While these headphones are incredibly comfortable and have a fantastic battery life, this may not be for the individual to use if  they're frequently around any background noise. While they do cancel out some noise, such as when you're driving a car, they do a poor job of cancelling background conversation or other things happening. While my husband is using them at work, I often get irritated because the background sounds are so loud, I have a hard time concentrating on what I'm saying. We end up hanging up after I ask him to call me back when he's in a quieter place."
"For music, I would rate these 5 stars. But as a Bluetooth speaker for talking on the phone almost 1 Star. It is shocking that Apple for the price, has not included any noise cancellation. We have tested it compared to a plantronics voyager. With the plantronics, I can vacuum or dry my hair and the person on the phone cannot hear it. With the Apple, it¡¯s amplified. It¡¯s a shame a company known for technology didn¡¯t incorporate noise cancellation in a very overpriced product."
